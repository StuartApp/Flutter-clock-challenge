# Ants Clock by Stuart

This is a Flutter project made by [https://stuart.com](Stuart) to provide a beautiful clock face for Flutter Clock Challenge.

More info about the contest can be found at [flutter.dev/clock](https://flutter.dev/clock).

This how it looks in a sunny day :)

A little bit of snow outside? Ants clock tells you:

Also you can check Ants Clock if it's a windy day:

Also more weather conditions like foggy, cloudy or rainy day are supported.

Additionally there is a nice night mode, that is very useful when the light emitted by clock can be annoying.
