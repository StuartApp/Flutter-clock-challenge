# Ants Clock by Stuart

This is a Flutter project made by [Stuart](https://stuart.com) to provide a beautiful clock face for Flutter Clock Challenge.

More info about the contest can be found at [flutter.dev/clock](https://flutter.dev/clock).

This how it looks in a sunny day :)

A little bit of snow outside? Ants clock tells you:

Is there a thunderstorm right now? Just check Ants Clock:

Also, you can check Ants Clock to see if it's a windy day:

More weather conditions like foggy, cloudy or rainy days are supported.

Additionally, there is a nice night mode that is very useful when the light emitted by the clock can be annoying.
